For the frontend system, I have used php 8.1 and Laravel version is updated to 
version ^8.0 for this system, and I so far tested that this version will not 
affect any of the current progress of this project.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# REMARKS

CONSIDER UPDATE OR INSTALL/UNINSTALL THE XAMPP VERSION INTO VERSION 8.1 TO GET TO USE 
THE PHP VERSION 8.1 OR ELSE YOU WILL BE FACING INCOMPATIBLE PHP RESTRICTIONS.

I AM SORRY THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DO IT IN THIS WAY, BUT THIS IS BECAUSE
MOST OF THE TIME I AM FACING LOTS OF PROBLEMS AND INCOMPATIBLE PACKAGE VERSIONS
WHILE WORKING ON THE FRONTEND IF THE PHP IS 8.0 OR BELOW.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider using the "composer self-update" or "composer self-update --2"
if you are facing composer version restrictions, smtg like that.

I have also added some other package versions and you can just delete
the package-lock.json files and "npm install" them, if needed.

Consider to use command "npm run dev"(one time) for laravel Mix to work
with the frontend files. Otherwise, the localhost won't work as 
it can't find the Mix files needed.


NOTES :
If any of you are facing errors or incompatible version of the packages or php files 
or if it involves something else with the files, please let me know so that we can 
discuss it on the group whatsapp.

Thank you,
